# WeightLiftingCalculator
Weight Lifting Calculator mobile app for the workout "Built For Battle" by Christian Thibaudeau. 

Here is a link to his workout: https://www.t-nation.com/workouts/built-for-battle

On monday, you will record your 3 rep max in a notebook or notes app. Every workout day after that, you will enter your current day and 3 rep max into my application to get your weight amounts at each percentage. The application also calculates how much weight to put on each side, starting with 45 lbs plates then adding additional weight. It is up to you to figure out the additional weight plates because there are many different combinations and it is relatively easy to figure out since the max weight will be less than 45.

I created this app using the IDE Visual Studio. I used Xamarin Forms which is a part of the  .NET Framework. I created this to use on my Samsung galaxy note 9, but it should also work for any other android device and iOS device. I've tested on a pixel 2 emulator and it looks good. I have not tested on any other devices, therefore it is up to you to test it and get back to me.

If you have any questions or bugs you would like to report to me, please let me know at kalenwallin1@gmail.com
